This project focuses on implementing and training diffusion models for tasks like denoising, image generation, and class-conditional sampling. The project is split into two main parts:

---

## **Part A: The Power of Diffusion Models!**
**Notebook:** `180_proj5A_starter__DONE.ipynb`

### Description:
- Experiment with pre-trained diffusion models (DeepFloyd).
- Implement sampling loops for tasks such as inpainting and optical illusions.
- Explore iterative denoising and creative image manipulation techniques.

---

## **Part B: Diffusion Models from Scratch!**
**Notebook:** `cs180_proj5b_starter________RDONNE.ipynb`

### Description:
- Build and train your own diffusion model on the MNIST dataset.
- Implement key components:
  - Single-step denoising UNet.
  - Full diffusion model for image generation.
  - Class-conditional UNet for generating specific digit classes.
- Visualize results and analyze training loss.

### How to Use:
1. **Open the notebooks** in a Jupyter-compatible environment (e.g., Colab).
2. **Follow the provided instructions** within each notebook.
3. **Run the code** and analyze the outputs for each part.
